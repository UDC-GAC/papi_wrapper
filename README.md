[![MIT License][license-badge]](LICENSE.md)

Simple wrapper for PAPI most common used functions: set up events, start, stop
and print counters within a region of interest. Besides, within that region can
define many subregions in order to count them separately. Thus, this library
simplifies setting up low-level features of PAPI such as domain, granularity or
overflow.

PAPI's low-level API allows programmers to program different hardware counters
while executing a program. However, programming those coumarkoshorro#8648ion time: either
using flags or files.

This interface works for multithreaded programs using OpenMP; actually this was
the main reason for developing this interface. See [Usage](#usage) and
[Options](#options) sections for further details.

## Usage

It is only needed to rewrite our code as ( `<papi.h>` header files are already
included in `papi_wrapper` ):

``` 
#include <papi_wrapper.h>
...
pw_init_instruments; /* initialize counters */
pw_start_instruments; /* starts automatically PAPI counters */

/* region of interest (ROI) to measure */

pw_stop_instruments; /* stop counting */
pw_print_instruments; /* print results */
```

This way, it is only needed to add the header `#include <papi_wrapper.h>` to
the source code and compile with `-I/source/to/papi-wrapper papi_wrapper.c
-lpapi` .markoshorro#8648
#include <papi_wrapper.h>
...
pw_init_instruments(number_of_subregions); /* initialize counters */
pw_start_instruments; /* starts automatically PAPI counters */

/* region of interest (ROI) to measure */

pw_stop_instruments; /* stop counting */
pw_print_instruments; /* print results */
```

## Dependencies

 * PAPI >=5.x
 * GCC C compiler >=8.x
 * [PAPI library](https://icl.utk.edu/papi/news/news.html?id=382)

## Options

In order to differenciate PAPI macros and PAPI\_wrapper macros, as mnemonics
all PAPI\_wrapper options begin with the prefix `PW_` .

High-level configuration parameters:
 * `-DPW_THREAD_MONITOR` - default value `0` . Indicates the master thread if
`PW_MULTITHREAD` also enabled.
 * `-DPW_MULTITHREAD` - disabled by default. If not defined, only
`PW_THREAD_MONITOR` will count events (only one thread). This option is not
   compatible when using uncore events, it basically makes the PAPI library
   crash.
 * `-DPW_VERBOSE` - disabled by default. More text in the output and errors.
 * `-DPW_CSV` - disabled by default. Print in CSV format using comma
`-DPW_CSV_SEPARATOR=","` as divider where first row contains the thread number 
and the names of the hardware counters used, containing the following rows each thread and its counter values.

Low-level configuration parameters (refer to [PAPI](https://icl.utk.edu/papi/)
for further information):
 * `-DPW_GRN=<granularity>` - default value `PAPI_GRN_MIN` .
 * `-DPW_DOM=<domain>` - default value `PAPI_DOM_ALL` .
 * `-DPW_SAMPLING` - disabled by default. Enables sampling for all the events
   specified in `PW_FLIST` with thresholds specified in `PW_FSAMPLE` .

Configuration files (see their format in the repo):

   threshold of counters specified in `PW_FLIST` . Useless if `PW_SAMPLE` not
   specified.

## Implementation details

PAPI wrapper may be precompiled and linked to your executable or compiled
directly with your sources. PAPI wrapper basically initializes a PAPI event set
for each counter specified in the `PW_FLIST` . If multithread is enabled, then
all threads will count events individually and simultaneously, but one counter
at a time. Multiplexing is a experimental feature that should be avoided in
PAPI, since in [PAPI's discussions there is some skepticism regarding its
reliability](https://groups.google.com/a/icl.utk.edu/forum/#!searchin/ptools-perfapi/multiplexing%7Csort:date/ptools-perfapi/gi3e0EBVRGo/2x5kB3dEDwAJ).

## Overhead

When talking about the overhead of a library, we can think about the overhead
of using it regarding execution time or memory. In any case, overheads:

 * Costs of the PAPI library: initializing the library, starting counters, 
   stoping them. For further details refer to `papi_cost` utility.
 * Costs of PAPI wrapper: iterating over the list of events to measure. Each
   counter is measured individually, so there is no concurrency at all when it
   comes to measure different events. There is only concurrency when measuring
   different thread: they are all measured at the same time

### Limitations

With the major version 1.0.0, PAPI wrapper introduces subregions, which
basically permits measuring different regions of code simoultaneously and
individually. Nonetheless, if the region or subregion measured has an order of
magnitude lower than the proper PAPI library cost (refer to
[Overhead](#overhead)), the result will have too much noise.
